```{admonition} What we do 🧠 🧐 🖥️
:class: hint

We combine computational methods and neuroimaging data to study both the shared and individual aspects of the brain’s functional architecture.
Our work uses [hyperalignment](research/hyperalignment.md) to characterize [individual differences](research/individual_differences.md) at fine spatial scales (voxel- or vertex-level).
We study how these differences develop and how they relate to intelligence, personality, and disorders.
We also build and improve [brain templates](research/templates.md), as well as compare human brains with [monkey brains and artificial neural networks](research/species_systems.md) to examine commonalities and differences across species and systems.
