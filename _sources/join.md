- Research experience, such as neuroimaging data acquisition, analysis, experimental design, or publications;
- Motivation and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research aligned with our [research directions](research/index.md).

Candidates are **not expected to meet every criterion listed above**. The most important qualities we seek are **motivation, intellectual curiosity, and a strong willingness to learn**.
