```{admonition} Research at the Feilong Lab
:class: hint
Our research spans multiple themes in computational and cognitive neuroscience.
We focus on decoding and predicting [individualized brain responses](pred_responses.md) and linking [individual differences](individual_differences.md) in brain organization to behavior and cognition.
To achieve this, we develop and refine advanced tools for neuroimaging data analysis, including [hyperalignment](hyperalignment.md) and [brain templates](templates.md).
We also examine how similar functions are implemented across different [species and systems](species_systems.md), from humans and non-human primates to artificial neural networks.
